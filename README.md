# Project Description

This purpose of this project was to collaborate with a group of developers to create an application with the following criterias:

```
1. Atleast one CSS framework
2. At least one server-side API
3. An application that is responsive and interactive
4. An application with a polished UI
5. A clean repository
```

Our application utilizes NASA's APOD API. Our team committed to utilizing this API due to the variety of different functionalities, as well as the compelling content that it offers. Our main objective was to have the ability for the user to access NASA's APOD API which has a giant database of pictures related to astronomy; complete with an identifying title and brief summary of the photograph taken.

StarGazer's current components: 

```
• Landing Page
• Displays NASA's 'picture-of-the-day' with matching summary
• Date picker to traverse through NASA's APOD API 
```

We initially built the HTML and then slightly formatted the CSS to have a basic interface and in conjunction with Javascript, created the functionality that allows the user to fetch, retrieve, and display the data inside NASA's APOD API. From there, our team established a date picker in order to grant the user the capability to display the picture of the day from the date of their choosing.
