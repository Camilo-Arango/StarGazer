# Project Description

This purpose of this project was to collaborate with a group of developers to create an application that would solve a real-world problem.  

For this project we needed to use a CSS framework, use at least one server-side API, have the site be responsive and interactive, and have a polished UI as well as a clean repository.

We decided to use the NASA API because it has a lot of different functionality and it seemed like something that people haven't really done in the past for this project. 

Our main objective was to have the ability for the user to access NASA's APOD API which has a giant database of pictures taken of space with an identifying title and description of the history of the constellation or picture that was taken. 

We first built the HTML structure and then slightly formatted the CSS to have a basic structure and then added in the Javascript to access NASA's APOD API. We then edited the javascript and html to add in a date picker so that the user could interact with the date and choose which date they wanted to see a picture from. We then made the javascript responsive to the user's selection by adding an event listener on the change of the date.
